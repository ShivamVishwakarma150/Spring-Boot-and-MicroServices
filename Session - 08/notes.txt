Dependency Injection
+++++++++++++++++++++

->The process of injecting one class object into another class object is called as Dependency Injection.

-> We can perform Dependency Injection in three ways 
   
    1) Setter Injection
    2) Constructor Injection
    3) Field Injection

-> The process of injecting one class object into another class object using Setter method then it is called as Setter Injection.

Ex :: 
    
    BillCollector bc= new BillCollector();
    bc.SetPayment(new CreditCardPayment())

-> The process of injecting one class object into another class object using Constructor is called as Constructor Injection.

Ex:: 
    BillCollector bc1 = new BillCollector(new CreditCardPayment());
	bc1.collectPayment(150.00);


-> The process of injecting one class object into another class object using variable is called as Field Injection.

Note: if variable is declared as public then we can access that variable outside of the class we can initialize directly.

Note: If variable is declared as private then we can't access that variable outside of the class directly. To access private variable outside of the class we can use Reflection api.
