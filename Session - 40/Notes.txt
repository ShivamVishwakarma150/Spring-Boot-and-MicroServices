XML & JAX-B 
############# 

-> XML stands for Extensible Markup Language 

-> XML is free & open source -> XML is interoperable (Language independent & Platform independent) 


-> XML we can use to transfer data from one application to another application 

-> XML introduced by w3c org 

-> The initial version of xml is 1.0 and the current version of xml is also 1.0 

-> XML will represent data in the form of elements 

-> An element is the combination of start tag and end tag 
    Ex: <name> India </name> 

-> We will have 2 types of elements in the XML
    1) Simple Element 
    2) Compound Element 
    
-> The element which contains data directly is called as Simple Element 
    <name> India </name> 
    <type> Country </type>


-> The element which contains child element(s) is called as Compound Element 
    <person> 
        <id> 101 </id> 
        <name> raju </name> 
    </person> 
    
Note: here <person> is a compound element and <id> <name> are simple elements 


-> We can have attributes also for the element 
    <student branch="CSE"> 
        <id> 101 </id> 
        <name> Mahesh </name> 
    </student> 
    
Note: XML should have only one root element. Inside the root element we can have multiple child elements.

<persons> 
    <person> 
        <id> 101 </id> 
        <name> raju </name> 
    </person> 
    <person> 
        <id> 101 </id> 
        <name> raju </name> 
    </person> 
</persons>


########### 
JAX-B 
############ 


-> JAX-B stands for Java Architecture For XML Binding 

-> JAX-B is used to convert Java object to xml and xml to java object 

-> JAX-B is free and open source -> JAX-B given by sun microsystems. 

-> JAX-B is part of JDK up to 1.8v 

-> If you are using JDK 1.8+ version of java then you need to add JAX-B dependency in pom.xml file .

-> The process of converting Java Object into xml is called as "Marshalling" 

-> The process of converting XML data to Java Object is called as "Un-Marshalling" 

-> To perform Marshalling and Un-Marshalling We need to design Binding Classes.

-> The java class which represents the structure of XML is called as Binding class. 

-> JAX-B provided annotations to represent java class as Binding Class. 

Note: Binding Class creation is one time operation. 

Note: Earlier people used to create Binding Classes using XSD. XSD represents structure of xml.
