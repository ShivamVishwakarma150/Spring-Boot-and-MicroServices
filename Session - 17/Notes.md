# Here's an enhanced explanation of the points you mentioned:

1) IOC Container Startup in Spring Boot:
   - In Spring Boot, the IOC (Inversion of Control) container is responsible for managing beans and their dependencies. The container is automatically started as part of the `run()` method in the Spring Boot application.
   - The `run()` method internally uses different implementations of the ApplicationContext to start the IOC container based on the dependencies in the project.
   - For example, the `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` is used for the boot-starter module, `AnnotationConfigServletWebServerApplicationContext` for the boot-starter-web module, and `AnnotationConfigReactiveWebServerApplicationContext` for the starter-webflux module.
   - Depending on the specific starter used, the appropriate ApplicationContext implementation is chosen to start the IOC container.

2) @Component Annotation:
   - The `@Component` annotation is used in Spring (including Spring Boot) to mark a class as a Spring Bean.
   - By annotating a class with `@Component`, we indicate to the IOC container that it should manage an instance of that class as a bean.
   - Spring Boot uses component scanning to automatically detect classes annotated with `@Component` (along with other stereotype annotations such as `@Controller`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, etc.) and register them as beans in the IOC container.
   - These beans can then be autowired into other components or used by the application.

3) Banner in Spring Boot:
   - In Spring Boot, the banner is the logo or text that is displayed in the console when the application starts.
   - The banner can be customized by creating a file named `banner.txt` in the `src/main/resources` directory of the project.
   - The `banner.txt` file can contain ASCII art or text-based designs representing the desired banner.
   - Various online tools, like the one mentioned (https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Shivam%20Sharma), can be used to generate ASCII art for the banner.
   - Spring Boot supports three banner modes: "console" (default), "log", and "off".
   - The banner mode can be configured in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file using the property `spring.main.banner-mode`.

4) Runners in Spring Boot:
   - Runners in Spring Boot are used to execute specific logic once the application has started.
   - Spring Boot provides two types of runners: `ApplicationRunner` and `CommandLineRunner`.
   - Both runners are functional interfaces with a single abstract method, `run()`, which is invoked after the application context has been initialized.
   - Use cases for runners include tasks such as sending emails, loading data into caches, or performing any logic that needs to be executed only once when the application starts.
   - To use runners, create a class and implement either the `ApplicationRunner` or `CommandLineRunner` interface, and override the `run()` method with the desired logic.
   - Annotate the class with `@Component` to make it a Spring Bean, and Spring Boot will automatically detect and execute the runner's `run()` method.
