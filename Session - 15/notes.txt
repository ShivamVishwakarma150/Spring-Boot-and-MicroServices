Spring Boot & Microservices 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++ 
-> Spring is an application development framework 
-> By using spring framework we can develop below types of applications 
    1) standalone applications
    2) web applications 
    3) distributed applications 

-> Spring framework developed in modular fashion 

-> Spring framework came into market in 2004 

-> The current version of Spring is 5.x 

-> Spring is non-invasive framework 

-> Spring is versatile framework 

Note: When we develop application by using spring, programmer is responsible to take care of configurations required for the application.

-> After few years Spring team realized that for every project configurations are required 

-> Every Programmer dealing with configurations in the project

-> The configurations are common in the project 

=> To overcome configuration problems spring team released Spring Boot into market 

+++++++++++++++ 
Spring Boot 
++++++++++++++++ 

=> It is another approach to develop spring based applications with less configurations

=> Spring Boot is an enhancement of Spring framework 

=> Spring Boot internally uses Spring framework only 

=> What type of applications we can develop using spring framework, same type of applications can be developed by using Spring boot also 

Spring Boot = Spring Framework - XML Configurations

Spring Boot Advantages 
+++++++++++++++++++++++ 

1) Auto Configuration 
2) POM starters 
3) Embedded Servers 
4) Rapid Development 
5) Actuators -> Auto configuration means boot will identify the configurations required

for our application and it will provide that configurations 
- Starting IOC container 
- Creating Connection Pool 
- Creation SMTP Connections 
- Web Application Deployment to server 
- Depedency Injections etc.... 

-> POM starters are nothing but dependencies that we use to develop our application 
a) web-starter 
b) jdbc-starter 
c) security-starter
d) mail-starter 

-> Boot will provide web server to run our web applications. Those servers are called as Embedded Server 
    a) Tomcat (default) 
    b) Jetty 
    c) Netty 
    
-> Rapid Development means fast development. We can focus only on
business logic because Boot will take care of configurations.



-> Actuators are used to monitor and manage our application. Actuators providing production-ready features for our application. 

    a) How many classes loaded 
    b) how many objects created 
    c) how many threads are running 
    d) URL Mappings Available 
    e) Health of the project etc...
