Spring Data JPA 
++++++++++++++++ 


-> It is used to develop persistence logic in our application

-> The logic which is responsible to communicate with database is called as Persistence Logic 


-> Already we have JDBC, Spring JDBC, Hibernate, Spring ORM to develop persistence logic 

-> If we use JDBC,or Spring JDBC or Hibernate or Spring ORM then we should common logics in all DAO classes to perform CRUD Operations 

-> Data JPA simplified persistence logic development by providing pre-defined interfaces with methods 

-> Data JPA provided Repository methods to perform CRUD operations 

Note: If we use Data JPA then we don't need to write logic to perform CRUD operations bcz Data JPA will take care of that 

-> Data JPA provided Repository interfaces to perform CURD operations 
    1) CrudRepository (Methods to perform Crud Operations) 
    2) JpaRepository (Methods to perform Crud Operations + Pagination + Sorting + QBE)


Hibernate Vs Data JPA 
++++++++++++++++++++++ 

-> In Hibernate we should implement all methods to perform CRUD operations 

-> Data JPA providing predefined methods to perform CRUD Operations 

-> In Hibernate we should boiler plate code (same code in multiple classes) 

-> In Data JPA we don't need to write any method because JPA Repositories providing methods for us.
