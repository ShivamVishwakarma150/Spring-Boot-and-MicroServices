=> Spring Boot is just one approach to develop spring Based application with less configurations.

=> Spring boot came into market with Auto configuration concept.

Note: Spring Boot will take care of configurations required for our application.

=> we can do rapid development using springBoot.


Application Development
+++++++++++++++++++++++++


=> Application Development divided into 2 parts 
        1) backend Development
        2) Frontend Development 

    FullStack Development  = Backend Development + Frontend Development

=> Backend contains the business logic of our application

    (webservice calls, validations, email logic, db communication)

=> Frontend contains user interface of the application
        (presentation logic)

=> End users interact with frontend of our application. Frontend will interact with Backend of our application. Backend will execute business logic and it will communicate with database also.

=> The developers who can do backend and Frontend development they are called as FullStack developers.

Monolith vs Microservices
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



Monolith Architecture Based Application
---------------------------------------

=> If we develop all the functionalities in the single project then it is called as Monolith Architecture based application.

Drawback :- 
1) Code changes integration is difficult
2) Classes will be tightly coupled 
3) For any change, whole project should be re-deployed
4) Maintenance is difficult
5) Single point of failure

Microservices Architecture Based Application
---------------------------------------------

For each functionalities we are creating separate small small api's which is nothing but REST API's.
and springBoot is used to develop these REST API's by following Microservices Architecture.

Advantages:-
1) Project functionalities distributed to several API's
2) Maintenance is easy 
3) Issue fixing is easy
4) Development is easy
