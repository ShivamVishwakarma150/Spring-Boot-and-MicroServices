################ 
What is HTTP ? 
################ 

-> HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol 

-> It acts as a mediator between client & server ( Consumer & Provider ) 

-> Consumer application will send HTTP Req to Provider application 

-> Provider application will process the request and it will send HTTP response to Consumer

############### 
HTTP Methods 
############### 


-> HTTP methods are used to send request from Consumer application to Provider application 

-> HTTP method will represent what type of operation client / consumer wants to perform with Provider 
    a) GET 
    b) POST 
    c) PUT 
    d) DELETE 
    
-> GET request is used to retrieve data from Server / Provider application. 


-> GET request will not have body to send data in the request 

-> To send any data using GET request then we will use Path Params & Query Params 

Note: Path Params & Query Params data will be displayed in the URL 

Note: It is not recommended to send sensitive / secret data using Path Params & Query Params 

-> GET request is Idempotent (means if you send same GET request for multiple times also nothing will change at server) 




POST 
====


-> POST request is used to create a new record at server 

-> When consumer wants to send huge data/ sensitive data then Consumer will use POST request 

-> POST request contains request body 

-> POST request is Non-Idempotent 

Note: In POST request we can send data in URL and in Request Body. 

Note: Request Body is the recommended approach to send sensitive data to server 


PUT 
===

-> PUT request is used to update a record at server 

-> When consumer wants to update a record at then consumer will send PUT request to Provider 

-> PUT request contains request body -> PUT request is Idempotent Note: In PUT request we can send data in URL and in Request Body. 

Note: Request Body is the recommended approach to send sensitive data to server 



DELETE
======

-> DELETE request is used to delete a record at server 

-> DELETE request contains request body 

-> DELETE request is Idempotent 

Note: In DELETE request we can send data in URL and in Request Body.

1) Initial Request Line ( HTTP method + URL ) 

2) Request Headers ( key-value ) 

3) Blank Line to separate Header & Body 

4) Request Body (Request Payload)

###################### 
HTTP Response Structure 
#######################

2) Response Headers (Key-value) 

3) Blank Line to separate Header & Body

################## 
HTTP Status Codes 
################## 

-> HTTP Status codes will represent how the request process by server / provider

2xx (200 - 299) ---> OK (success) 

3xx (300 - 399) ---> Redirect 

4xx (400 - 499) ---> Client Error
