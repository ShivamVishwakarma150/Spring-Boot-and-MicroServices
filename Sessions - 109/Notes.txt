How to disable Pre-instantiation on singleton scope spring beans?
==================================

Ans) By using lazy-init="true" we can disable pre-instantiation on singleton scope spring bean

    <bean id='dtdc' class="com.st.comp.DTDC" lazy-init="true"/>



Q)if lazy-init enabled singleton scope bean is dependent to singleton scope target spring bean class then what happens?
-------------------------------------------
Ans) The lazy-init enabled singleton scope spring bean also participates in pre-instantiation in supports the pre-instantiation of singleton scope target spring bean.


     <bean id="dtdc" class="com.st.comp.DTDC" lazy-init="true"/>

    <!-- cfg Target class -->
    <bean id="fpkt" class="com.st.comp.Flipkart">
        <property name="courier"  ref="dtdc"/>
    </bean>



Q) we have 10 spring beans cfg in spring bean cfg file.. how to enable pre-instantiation only 5 spring beans?
========================================

case1:: 

=>Take 5 spring beans as the singleton scope spring beans

=> Another 5 spring beans as the prototype scope spring beans

=> make sure that prototype spring beans are not taken as the dependent spring beans
