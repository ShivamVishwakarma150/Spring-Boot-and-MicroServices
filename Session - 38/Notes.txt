RESTFul Services 
+++++++++++++++ 


-> REST stands for 'Representational State Transfer' 

-> RESTFul services are used to develop Distributed Applications with
Interoperability 

-> If one application is communicating with another application then those are called as 'Distributed Apps' 

-> Interoperability means irrespective of the platform and language applications can communicate 
    java app <-----------> .Net app 
    .Net app <----------> Python app 
    Python app <---------> Java App 
    
-> Distributed applications are used for B 2 B communications 

-> B2B means Business to Business Communication 

-> Distributed Application will re-use services of one application in
another application 

-> RESTful Services are providing 'Intereoperability' 

-> Two Actors will be involved in Distributed Applications development 
    1) Provider 
    2) Consumer 
    
-> The application which is providing business services is called as Provider Application


-> The application which is accessing business services is called as Consumer Application 

Note: One provider application can have multiple consumer applications 

-> Provider and Consumer will communicate using HTTP as a mediator 

-> Provider and Consumer will exchange the data in Text / XML / JSON format 

Note: In Industry we will use JSON format to exchange data from one application to another application 


-> To start our journey with RESTFul services development we should be good in below areas 
    1) HTTP Protocol (Methods, Status Codes, Req structure & Res Structure) 
    2) XML and JAX-B Api 
    3) JSON and Jackson Api

What is HTTP ? 
################ 

-> HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol 

-> It acts as a mediator between client & server ( Consumer & Provider ) 

-> Consumer application will send HTTP Req to Provider application 

-> Provider application will process the request and it will send HTTP response to Consumer
