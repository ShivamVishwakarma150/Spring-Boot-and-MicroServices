Spring Security
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> For every application we should provide some security to protect that application from hackers.

-> In realtime applications, every client is asking to provide security

-> As per the most recent verizon data breach investigation report-2020, 43% of data breaches were attacks on web applications.

-> To protect our application from hacker attacks & data breaches we can use Spring Security concept.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Spring Security works on a concept called JAAS (Java Authentication & Authorization Services).

-> In brief, Spring security mainly works on javax.servlet.Filter concept.

-> Filters are used to apply some pre-processing logic based on that we can decide weather to process that request or not.

-> In Spring Security we have predefined filter class to apply pre-processing logic for the request

			DelegatingFilterProxy

-> DelegatingFilterProxy will check for below 2 things

		1) Authentication
		2) Authorization



-> Authentication is the process of checking weather this user can access our application or not.

-> Authorization is the process of checking weather this user having access for this functionality/page or not.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> We can implement spring boot security authentication in below 3 ways

	i) In-Memory Credentials Security
	ii) Using Data base (JDBC)
	iii) Using UserDetailsService


-> We can implement spring boot security authorization in below 4 ways

i) permitAll  : no authorization required, all pages can be accessed
ii) authenticated : if authentication pass, page can access 
iii) hasAuthority : If user authenticated and authorized then only he can
iv) hasAnyAuthority : if user having any role which are configure then it can access
