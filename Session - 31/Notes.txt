Note-2 : tomcat-embed-jasper will provide the support to work with JSP files in Spring Web MVC 

Note-3 : devtools is used to re-start the server when changes happened in the code. 

Note-4 : Java class will be represented as a Spring Controller using @Controller annotation


Note-5 : Controller class methods should be binded to HTTP Protocol methods to handle HTTP Requests
