Dependency injection => the process of injecting one class object into another class object is known as Dependency injection.



constructor injection
Another Approach to do the injection


setter injection
Another Approach to do the injection



package in.shivam;

public class BillCollector {
	private IPayment payment;
	
    // for setter injection
	public void setPayment(IPayment payment) {
		this.payment = payment;
	}
	
	public BillCollector() {
		
	}
	
    // for constructor injection
	public BillCollector(IPayment payment) 	{
		this.payment=payment;
	}
	
	public void collectPayment(double amount) {
		// As it is tightly coupled then it is not recommended way 
//		CreditCardPayment ccd= new CreditCardPayment();
//		ccd.pay(amount);
		String status = payment.pay(amount);
		
		System.out.println(status);
	}
}



package in.shivam;
public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		BillCollector bc = new BillCollector();
		
		// setter injection is the process of injecting one class object into another class object
		// Injecting CreditCard obj into BillCollector (Setter Injection)
        //bc.setPayment(new CreditCardPayment());
		
		//constructor injection
		// Another Approach to do the injection
		// injecting CreditCard obj into BillCollector (Constructor Injection)
		BillCollector bc1 = new BillCollector(new CreditCardPayment());
		bc.collectPayment(150.00);
