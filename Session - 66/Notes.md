The provided code demonstrates how to configure Spring Boot Security with JDBC authentication. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

  

Step 1: Setup Database tables with required data

- This step involves creating two tables: `users` and `authorities`.

- The `users` table stores user information such as username, password, and enabled status.

- The `authorities` table stores the username and corresponding authority (role) of each user.

  

Step 2: Create Boot application with required dependencies

- Add the necessary dependencies to your Spring Boot application, including:

-  `web-starter`: for building web applications

-  `security-starter`: for Spring Security support

-  `data-jdbc`: for JDBC database connectivity

-  `mysql-connector`: for MySQL database support

-  `lombok`: for reducing boilerplate code

-  `devtools`: for development-time tools and automatic restarts

  

Step 3: Configure Data source properties

- In the `application.properties` file, specify the MySQL database connection properties, including the URL, username, password, and driver class name.

  

Step 4: Create a Rest Controller with required methods

- Create a `UserRestController` class that defines the REST endpoints for different user roles, such as `/admin`, `/user`, and `/`.

  

Step 5: Create a Security Configuration class with JDBC Authentication Manager

- Create a `SecurityConfiguration` class and annotate it with `@Configuration` and `@EnableWebSecurity`.

- Autowire the `DataSource` bean and the `AuthenticationManagerBuilder`.

- In the `authManager` method, configure JDBC authentication by specifying the data source, password encoder, and queries to retrieve user information and authorities from the database.

- Define a `SecurityFilterChain` bean that configures the authorization rules using the `HttpSecurity` object.

- In the `securityConfig` method, use the `HttpSecurity` object to define the authorization rules based on URL patterns and roles.

- In this example, the `/admin` endpoint requires the `ROLE_ADMIN` role, the `/user` endpoint requires either `ROLE_ADMIN` or `ROLE_USER` roles, and the `/` endpoint is accessible to all.

- The `formLogin()` method is used to enable form-based authentication.

  

Note: Make sure to include the necessary imports and dependencies in your code.

  
  

Let's go through the provided code and explain each section:

  

```java

@RestController

public  class  UserRestController {

  

@GetMapping(value = "/admin")

public  String  admin() {

return  "<h3>Welcome Admin :)</h3>";

}

  

@GetMapping(value = "/user")

public  String  user() {

return  "<h3>Hello User :)</h3>";

}

  

@GetMapping(value = "/")

public  String  welcome() {

return  "<h3>Welcome :)</h3>";

}

  

}

```

  

This code defines a `UserRestController` class annotated with `@RestController`, indicating that it's responsible for handling REST API requests. It contains three request mapping methods:

  

1.  `admin()`: This method handles GET requests for the `/admin` endpoint. It returns a simple HTML string `<h3>Welcome Admin :)</h3>`.

  

2.  `user()`: This method handles GET requests for the `/user` endpoint. It returns a simple HTML string `<h3>Hello User :)</h3>`.

  

3.  `welcome()`: This method handles GET requests for the root `/` endpoint. It returns a simple HTML string `<h3>Welcome :)</h3>`.
  
These methods are called when a request is made to the corresponding endpoints, and the returned HTML strings will be sent as the response.

  
```java

@Configuration

@EnableWebSecurity

public  class  SecurityConfiguration {
private  static  final  String  ADMIN = "ADMIN";
private  static  final  String  USER = "USER";

  

@Autowired

private  DataSource  dataSource;

  

@Autowired

public  void  authManager(AuthenticationManagerBuilder  auth) throws  Exception {
auth.jdbcAuthentication()
.dataSource(dataSource)
.passwordEncoder(new  BCryptPasswordEncoder())
.usersByUsernameQuery("select username,password,enabled from users where username=?")
.authoritiesByUsernameQuery("select username,authority from authorities where username=?");

}

@Bean

public  SecurityFilterChain  securityConfig(HttpSecurity  http) throws  Exception {
http.authorizeHttpRequests( (req) -> req
.antMatchers("/admin").hasRole(ADMIN)
.antMatchers("/user").hasAnyRole(ADMIN,USER)
.antMatchers("/").permitAll()
.anyRequest().authenticated()
).formLogin();

return  http.build();

}

  

}

```

  

This code defines a `SecurityConfiguration` class responsible for configuring Spring Security.

  

- The `@Configuration` annotation marks it as a configuration class, and `@EnableWebSecurity` enables Spring Security for the application.

  

- Two constants, `ADMIN` and `USER`, are defined to represent the role names.

  

- The `DataSource` is autowired, which will be used to configure JDBC authentication.

  

- The `authManager` method is annotated with `@Autowired` and accepts an `AuthenticationManagerBuilder` as a parameter. This method configures the authentication manager with JDBC authentication.

  

- The `jdbcAuthentication()` method configures JDBC-based authentication, specifying the data source, password encoder, and queries to retrieve user information and authorities from the database.

- The `usersByUsernameQuery()` method specifies the SQL query to retrieve the user details (username, password, enabled) based on the provided username.

- The `authoritiesByUsernameQuery()` method specifies the SQL query to retrieve the user's authorities (roles) based on the username.

  

- The `securityConfig` method is annotated with `@Bean` and accepts an `HttpSecurity` object as a parameter. This method configures the security filter chain using `HttpSecurity`.

  

- The `authorizeHttpRequests()` method configures the authorization rules for different URLs.

- The `antMatchers()` method is used to match specific URLs and apply role-based access restrictions.

- In this example

  

, the `/admin` endpoint requires the `ADMIN` role, the `/user` endpoint requires either the `ADMIN` or `USER` role, and the `/` endpoint is accessible to all (no authentication required).

- The `permitAll()` method allows unrestricted access to the root `/` endpoint.

- The `anyRequest().authenticated()` method specifies that any other request requires authentication.

- The `formLogin()` method enables form-based authentication.

  

The `SecurityConfiguration` class configures the authentication and authorization aspects of Spring Security for the application.

# AuthenticationManagerBuilder in Detail

  

Certainly! The `AuthenticationManagerBuilder` class in Spring Security is responsible for building and configuring the `AuthenticationManager`. The `AuthenticationManager` is a core component of Spring Security that performs authentication operations, such as validating credentials and loading user details.

  

The `AuthenticationManagerBuilder` provides a fluent API for configuring various authentication mechanisms and providers. Here are some important methods and concepts related to `AuthenticationManagerBuilder`:

  

1. `inMemoryAuthentication()`: This method configures in-memory authentication. It allows you to define users, passwords, and roles directly in your application's configuration. For example:

  

```java

auth.inMemoryAuthentication()

.withUser("user")

.password("{noop}password")

.roles("USER");

```

  

In the above example, the `inMemoryAuthentication()` method is used to configure an in-memory user with the username "user," password "password," and the role "USER". The `{noop}` prefix specifies that the password should be stored as plaintext. It's important to note that storing passwords as plaintext is not recommended for production environments.

  

2. `jdbcAuthentication()`: This method configures JDBC-based authentication. It allows you to authenticate users against a relational database using SQL queries. Here's an example:

  

```java

auth.jdbcAuthentication()

.dataSource(dataSource)

.usersByUsernameQuery("select username, password, enabled from users where username=?")

.authoritiesByUsernameQuery("select username, authority from authorities where username=?");

```

  

In the above example, the `jdbcAuthentication()` method is used to configure authentication using a JDBC data source. You need to provide the `DataSource` instance to connect to the database. The `usersByUsernameQuery()` method specifies the SQL query to retrieve user details (username, password, enabled) based on the provided username. The `authoritiesByUsernameQuery()` method specifies the SQL query to retrieve the user's authorities (roles) based on the username.

  

3. `userDetailsService()`: This method allows you to configure authentication using a custom implementation of the `UserDetailsService` interface. The `UserDetailsService` is responsible for loading user-specific data during the authentication process.

  

```java

auth.userDetailsService(myUserDetailsService);

```

  

In the above example, `myUserDetailsService` is a custom implementation of the `UserDetailsService` interface.

  

4. `authenticationProvider()`: This method allows you to configure a custom authentication provider. An authentication provider is responsible for performing the actual authentication process.

  

```java

auth.authenticationProvider(myAuthenticationProvider);

```

  

In the above example, `myAuthenticationProvider` is a custom implementation of the `AuthenticationProvider` interface.

  

These are just a few examples of how you can configure the `AuthenticationManagerBuilder` in Spring Security. You can explore more methods and options provided by `AuthenticationManagerBuilder` to customize the authentication process according to your application's requirements.

# HttpSecurity in Detail

The `HttpSecurity` class in Spring Security is used to configure security settings for HTTP requests in your application. It allows you to define authorization rules, specify authentication mechanisms, and handle various aspects of web security. Here are some important methods and concepts related to `HttpSecurity`:

1. `authorizeRequests()`: This method is used to define authorization rules for different URLs and HTTP methods. It allows you to specify which URLs should be accessible by different roles or users. For example:

```java
http.authorizeRequests()
    .antMatchers("/admin").hasRole("ADMIN")
    .antMatchers("/user").hasAnyRole("USER", "ADMIN")
    .anyRequest().authenticated();
```

In the above example, the `/admin` URL requires the role "ADMIN", the `/user` URL requires either the role "USER" or "ADMIN", and any other URL requires authentication (`authenticated()`). The `antMatchers()` method is used to match specific URLs, and the `hasRole()` and `hasAnyRole()` methods specify the required roles for access.

2. `formLogin()`: This method enables form-based authentication for your application. It configures a login form that users can submit to authenticate themselves. For example:

```java
http.formLogin()
    .loginPage("/login")
    .permitAll();
```

In the above example, the `formLogin()` method enables form-based authentication. The `loginPage()` method specifies the custom login page URL ("/login" in this case). The `permitAll()` method allows unrestricted access to the login page.

3. `logout()`: This method configures the logout functionality for your application. It allows users to log out and terminate their session. For example:

```java
http.logout()
    .logoutUrl("/logout")
    .logoutSuccessUrl("/login?logout")
    .invalidateHttpSession(true)
    .deleteCookies("JSESSIONID");
```

In the above example, the `logout()` method configures the logout URL ("/logout" in this case). The `logoutSuccessUrl()` method specifies the URL to redirect to after successful logout. The `invalidateHttpSession(true)` invalidates the user's session, and the `deleteCookies("JSESSIONID")` deletes the specified cookies upon logout.

4. `csrf()`: This method enables Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection. CSRF is an attack that tricks the user's browser into making unintended requests. Spring Security provides built-in protection against CSRF attacks. For example:

```java
http.csrf()
    .disable();
```

In the above example, the `csrf()` method is used to disable CSRF protection. Disabling CSRF protection should be done with caution and is not recommended in most production scenarios.

These are just a few examples of how you can configure the `HttpSecurity` class in Spring Security. You can explore more methods and options provided by `HttpSecurity` to customize the security settings and handle various aspects of web security in your application.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Certainly! Here are some additional methods and concepts related to `HttpSecurity` in Spring Security:

1. `antMatchers()`: This method is used to match specific URLs or patterns and apply security configurations to them. You can use it to define access rules based on URL patterns. For example:

```java
http.authorizeRequests()
    .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
    .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
    .anyRequest().authenticated();
```

In the above example, the `/public/**` pattern allows unrestricted access to URLs starting with `/public/`, the `/admin/**` pattern requires the role "ADMIN" for URLs starting with `/admin/`, and `anyRequest().authenticated()` applies authentication to all other URLs.

2. `permitAll()`: This method allows unrestricted access to the specified URLs. It can be used for public or unsecured endpoints that don't require authentication. For example:

```java
http.authorizeRequests()
    .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
    .anyRequest().authenticated();
```

In the above example, the `/public/**` pattern is configured to allow unrestricted access, while `anyRequest().authenticated()` ensures that all other requests require authentication.

3. `hasRole()` and `hasAnyRole()`: These methods are used to specify the required roles for accessing a URL. They provide a simple way to define role-based access control. For example:

```java
http.authorizeRequests()
    .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
    .antMatchers("/user/**").hasAnyRole("USER", "ADMIN")
    .anyRequest().authenticated();
```

In the above example, the `/admin/**` pattern requires the role "ADMIN", and the `/user/**` pattern requires either the role "USER" or "ADMIN" for access.

4. `authenticated()`: This method ensures that requests to the specified URLs require authentication. It is commonly used to secure sensitive endpoints that should only be accessed by authenticated users. For example:

```java
http.authorizeRequests()
    .antMatchers("/secure/**").authenticated()
    .anyRequest().permitAll();
```

In the above example, the `/secure/**` pattern requires authentication, while `anyRequest().permitAll()` allows unrestricted access to all other URLs.

5. `formLogin()`: This method enables form-based authentication and configures the login process for your application. It automatically generates a login page and handles the authentication flow. For example:

```java
http.formLogin()
    .loginPage("/login")
    .usernameParameter("username")
    .passwordParameter("password")
    .defaultSuccessUrl("/dashboard")
    .failureUrl("/login?error")
    .permitAll();
```

In the above example, the `formLogin()` method enables form-based authentication. The `loginPage()` method specifies the custom login page URL. The `usernameParameter()` and `passwordParameter()` methods allow you to customize the parameter names for the username and password inputs in the login form. The `defaultSuccessUrl()` method sets the URL to redirect to after successful authentication. The `failureUrl()` method sets the URL to redirect to in case of authentication failure. The `permitAll()` method allows unrestricted access to the login page.

These are some of the key methods and concepts related to `HttpSecurity` in Spring Security. The `HttpSecurity` class provides a wide range of methods to configure authentication, authorization, and other security-related aspects of your application. By using these methods effectively, you can define fine-grained security rules to protect your application's resources.
