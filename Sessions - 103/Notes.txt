candidate key column
====================

=> The column db tables whose values can be used to identify and access the records is ca;;ed candidate key column. Generally this colum does not allow duplicates and does not all values.

    Person_Info (db table)
    ----------------------
        |—> aadharNo  (ckc)
        |—> name
        |—> addrs
        |-—--> passportNo (ckc)
        |—>voterId (ckc)
        |-—>bankAcno (ckc)
        |—->email Id (ck)

CKC--Candidate key column


=>Primary key, Foreign key, Unique key, Not Null key and etc.. physical keys which can applied practically on db table cols

candidate key, natural key, surrogate key
and etc. logical keys


Natural key column 
==================

=>The candidate key column Whose values are having business meaning and will be changed because of the outside world business policies is called natural key column.. These column values expected from End users i.e they can not auto generated by App or DB s/w..
    
    eg:: adharNo, voterld , bankAcno , email Id ,passportNo, aadharNo and etc..


Surrogate key column
=====================

The candidate key column whose values are generated by underlying DB s/w or underlying App with out having any business meaning
of outside world is called Surrogate key column

eg:: sequence value generated by oracle Db s/w
eg:: Auto increment value given by mysql Db s/w
eg: Generators generated values in Hibernate programming (sequence, hilo ,seqhilo increment and etc..)


Limitations of taking Natural key column as PK column
===============================================

a) Values are very lengthy, so they need more memory to store

b) values are having business meaning i.e they will be changed because  of the outside
business policies .. So change in natural key colum value that is taken PK column
effects dependent db tables (FK columns) and relevant java classes and their dependent classes .. this change is going be very costly...

c) These values are expected from end user ..if end user does not supply these values .. record insertion process will be failed.

note:: We should not prefer taking Natural key columns as PK columns i.e taking aadharno, voterId , passport no and etc.. as PK column
is total bad practice..



Advantages of taking Surrogate key column as PK column
================================================

a) values are shorter values .. So they do not need much memory

b) values are generated by underlying Db s/w or Application dynamically with out having any business meaning.

So any change in outside business policies these values will not be distributed.

c) These values are not expected from end users.. So they will not raise any problem towards record insertion

eg1:: generated student no (pk col value) using sequence of oracle

eg2::generated student no (pk col value) using identity col of mysql (applying auto increment constraint)

Singleton java class
=====================

=>The java class that allows us to create only one object in any situation is called singleton java class

=>Instead of creating multiple objects for java class having no data or fixed data or sharable data .. just create object and use it for multiple times .. In that situation it better to take java class as singleton java class.

pre-defined singleton classes in java api
------------------------------------------  
    a) java.lang.Runtime (Because one java app execution contains only 1 runtime)

    b) java.awt.Desktop ( Because one computer contains only 1 desktop)

    c) org.apache.log4j.Logger ( Every project wants to have single Logging mechanism for all classes) and etc..

=> Though java class allows to create more objects .. if some one is just creating only object for that class then that class is not called singleton java class..

eg:: Servlet comp class is not singleton java class .. because servlet comp class not having restruction on more objects creation.. the Servlet container just creating only one object and using it.   

=>For real singleton java class should returns already created object when we attempt to create more than object.


Developing Singleton java class with minimum standards 
=============================================


a) Take only one private 0-param constructor (To stop object creation out side the class using new operator)

b) Take public static factory method to check whether object is already created or not.. if created return existing object ref .. if not created, then create new object and return its reference.

c) Take private static variable of type current singleton class to hold the single object that will be created.. same variable will also be used in static factory method to check whether single object already created or not.
