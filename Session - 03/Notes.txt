1) What is programming Language
2) What is Framework


-> Programming Language used by humans to communicate with Computers.
-> Programming Language contains set of instructions & syntaxes

    Ex: C, C++, Java, C#, Python etc....


-> Framework means semi-developed software.

-> Framework Will provide common logic which are required for application development.

-> If we don't use Framework in our application development then we should develop both business logics and common logics.

-> If we use framework then it will provide some common logics required for our application so that we can concentrate only on business logic development.

    Ex: Hibernate, Struts, Spring etc....

Hibernate : It is an ORM framework, Used to develop persistence layer of our application.

Struts : It is a web framework, Used to develop web layer of our application.(Outdated)

Spring : It is an application development framework. Entire project can be developed by using this.

    (we can do application end to end development)
