Certainly! Let's go through each point and provide a detailed explanation of the concepts mentioned in your notes.

1. In an application, several classes will be available:
   In any application, there are multiple classes that serve different purposes. These classes encapsulate specific functionality and can interact with each other to achieve desired behavior.

2. One class wants to talk to another class:
   In object-oriented programming, classes often need to communicate with each other to exchange data or collaborate on specific tasks. This communication can be achieved through method calls or by passing data between objects.

3. We are using an IOC container to perform dependency injection:
   Inversion of Control (IOC) is a principle that enables loose coupling and modular design in software development. An IOC container manages the creation and lifetime of objects, as well as their dependencies. It allows for dependency injection, where the container injects the required dependencies into a class instead of the class creating them itself.

4. We are giving instructions to IOC to inject a dependent object into the target object using the 'ref' attribute:
   In the configuration of the IOC container, you can specify how dependencies are injected into a class. The 'ref' attribute is used to refer to another object (bean) defined in the configuration file, and the container will inject that object into the target object when creating it.

5. This process is called Manual Wiring:
   Manual Wiring refers to the explicit configuration of dependencies in the IOC container configuration file. In this process, you specify the dependencies of a class using the 'ref' attribute, indicating which objects should be injected.

6. Spring IOC supports the Autowiring concept:
   Spring IOC (Inversion of Control) container supports the Autowiring concept, which enables automatic detection and injection of dependencies into a class. Instead of explicitly configuring dependencies, Spring can automatically wire the required objects based on certain rules.

7. By default, Autowiring is disabled, and we need to enable it:
   By default, Autowiring is turned off in the Spring IOC container. You need to explicitly enable it to take advantage of automatic dependency injection.

8. Autowiring will not work for primitive data types; it only works for reference data types:
   Autowiring is designed to work with reference data types, such as objects, rather than primitive data types like integers or booleans. Autowiring is primarily used to inject dependencies between objects.

9. Autowiring modes:
   Spring provides several modes for Autowiring dependencies:

   a) byName: The container looks for a bean with the same name as the dependency. If a matching bean is found, it is injected into the target object.

   b) byType: The container looks for a bean whose type matches the dependency. If exactly one matching bean is found, it is injected. If multiple beans are found, an ambiguity error occurs.

   c) constructor: Similar to byType, but the injection is performed through constructor arguments rather than properties.

   d) no: No Autowiring is performed. Dependencies must be explicitly configured using the 'ref' attribute.

   These Autowiring modes provide flexibility in defining how dependencies are resolved and injected.

10. Ambiguity problem with byType Autowiring:
    If you configure a class multiple times with different IDs but the same type, there can be ambiguity when using byType Autowiring. The container won't be able to determine which bean to inject because there are multiple candidates with the same type. In such cases, it's recommended to use other Autowiring modes or provide explicit wiring using the 'ref' attribute.

By understanding and applying these concepts, you can effectively manage dependencies between classes and leverage Spring's Autowiring capabilities for dependency injection.

# Let's go through each Autowiring mode in detail, provide code examples, explanations, and a conclusion.

a) Autowiring Mode: byName

Code example:
```xml
<bean id="car" class="in.shivam.beans.Car" autowire="byName">
</bean>
```

Explanation:
- In this mode, the container looks for a bean with the same name as the dependency.
- If a matching bean with the same name as the dependency is found, it is injected into the target object.
- The `autowire` attribute is set to `"byName"` in the bean definition to enable Autowiring by name.

Conclusion for byName:
With Autowiring by name, Spring will search for a bean with the same name as the dependency and inject it into the target object. This mode is useful when you want to wire dependencies based on their names.

b) Autowiring Mode: byType

Code example:
```xml
<bean id="car" class="in.shivam.beans.Car" autowire="byType">
</bean>
```

Explanation:
- In this mode, the container looks for a bean whose type matches the dependency.
- If exactly one matching bean with the required type is found, it is injected into the target object.
- If multiple beans with the same type are found, an ambiguity error occurs because the container cannot determine which bean to inject.

Conclusion for byType:
Autowiring by type allows Spring to automatically wire dependencies based on their types. It simplifies the configuration process by avoiding explicit dependency declarations. However, it can lead to ambiguity errors if multiple beans with the same type are present.

c) Autowiring Mode: constructor

Code example:
```xml
<bean id="car" class="in.shivam.beans.Car" autowire="constructor">
</bean>
```

Explanation:
- In this mode, the container looks for a bean whose type matches the constructor parameter type.
- The injection is performed through constructor arguments rather than properties.
- The container tries to match the constructor argument types with the beans defined in the container and injects them accordingly.

Conclusion for constructor:
Autowiring by constructor is similar to Autowiring by type, but the injection is done through constructor arguments. It can simplify the configuration process by eliminating the need for explicit setter methods. However, be cautious when using this mode with multiple constructors or when ambiguity arises.

d) Autowiring Mode: no

Code example:
```xml
<bean id="car" class="in.shivam.beans.Car" autowire="no">
</bean>
```

Explanation:
- In this mode, no Autowiring is performed by the container.
- Dependencies must be explicitly configured using the `ref` attribute in the bean definition.
- The `autowire` attribute is set to `"no"` to disable Autowiring.

Conclusion for no:
Autowiring is disabled in this mode, and dependencies must be explicitly configured using the `ref` attribute. This mode provides full control over dependency injection and is useful when fine-grained control is required.

Overall Conclusion:
Spring provides different Autowiring modes to facilitate automatic dependency injection. The byName mode injects dependencies based on bean names, byType mode injects dependencies based on bean types, constructor mode injects dependencies through constructor arguments, and the no mode disables Autowiring. Each mode has its own advantages and considerations, and the appropriate mode depends on the specific requirements of your application.

By understanding and utilizing these Autowiring modes, you can effectively configure dependencies in your Spring application and leverage the power of the IOC container for automatic dependency injection.


# Let's start with the code provided:

```java
package in.shivam.beans;

public class Car {
	private DieselEngine dieselEng;
	
	public void setDieselEng(DieselEngine dieselEng) {
		this.dieselEng = dieselEng;
	}
	
	public Car() {
		System.out.println("Car::Constructor");
	}
	
	public void drive() {
		int start = dieselEng.start();
		if (start >= 1) {
			System.out.println("Journey Started...");
		} else {
			System.out.println("Engine Failed to Start...!!");
		}
	}
}
```

Explanation:
- The `Car` class represents a car that has a dependency on a `DieselEngine` object.
- The `dieselEng` instance variable is declared to hold the `DieselEngine` object.
- The `setDieselEng` method is a setter method used for dependency injection. It sets the `DieselEngine` object in the `Car` class.
- The `Car` class also has a default constructor that prints a message when the `Car` object is instantiated.
- The `drive` method simulates driving the car by calling the `start` method of the `DieselEngine` object. If the engine starts successfully (return value >= 1), it prints a success message; otherwise, it prints an error message.

```java
package in.shivam.beans;

public class DieselEngine {
	public DieselEngine() {
		System.out.println("DieselEngine::Constructor");
	}
	
	public int start() {
		// logic
		System.out.println("DieselEngine Starting...");
		return 1;
	}
}
```

Explanation:
- The `DieselEngine` class represents a diesel engine.
- It has a default constructor that prints a message when the `DieselEngine` object is instantiated.
- The `start` method simulates starting the diesel engine and returns an integer value (in this case, 1) to indicate a successful start.

```java
package in.shivam.main;

import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;

import in.shivam.beans.Car;

public class Driver {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("Spring-Beans.xml");
		
		Car car = context.getBean("car", Car.class);
		car.drive();
	}
}
```

Explanation:
- The `Driver` class is the entry point of the application.
- It creates an `ApplicationContext` using `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` by providing the path to the XML configuration file (`Spring-Beans.xml`).
- The `ApplicationContext` loads the bean definitions from the XML file and creates the necessary objects.
- It retrieves the `Car` bean from the container using the bean id ("car") and the class type (`Car.class`).
- Finally, it calls the `drive` method on the `Car` object to simulate driving the car.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">
	
	<bean id="diesel" class="in.shivam.beans.DieselEngine"/>
	
	<bean id="car" class="in.shivam.beans.Car" autowire="byType">
	</bean>
  
</beans>
```

Explanation:
- The XML configuration file defines the beans and their dependencies for the Spring container.
- The `<bean>` tags define the beans, with `id` representing the unique identifier and `class` specifying the fully qualified class name.
- The `<bean>` tag with `id="diesel"` defines the `DieselEngine` bean.
- The `<bean>` tag with `id="car"` defines the `Car` bean. It also specifies `autowire="byType"`, enabling Autowiring by type.
- Since Autowiring by type is enabled, the container will automatically inject the `DieselEngine` bean into the `Car` bean because they have a matching type.

Conclusion:
In this example, the code demonstrates dependency injection using Spring's IOC container. The `Car` class has a dependency on the `DieselEngine` class, which is automatically injected by the container. This is achieved by enabling Autowiring by type in the XML configuration file. The `Driver` class obtains the `Car` object from the container and calls the `drive` method, which simulates driving the car by starting the diesel engine.

Through this example, you can observe how Spring's IOC container handles object creation and dependency injection, allowing for loosely coupled and modular code.

In the provided code, the Autowiring mode `"byType"` is specified for the `car` bean. Let's understand how Autowiring by type works in this scenario:

1. XML Configuration:
   - The XML configuration file (`Spring-Beans.xml`) defines the beans and their dependencies.
   - The `car` bean has the attribute `autowire="byType"`, indicating that Autowiring by type should be performed for this bean.

2. Container Initialization:
   - The `ApplicationContext` is created using the `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext` class, specifying the XML configuration file.
   - The container loads the configuration file and creates the necessary beans.

3. Autowiring by Type:
   - When the container encounters the `car` bean definition, it identifies that Autowiring by type is enabled for this bean.
   - The container scans the other beans defined in the configuration file to find a bean with a type that matches the type of the dependency of the `car` bean.
   - In this case, the container searches for a bean with the type `DieselEngine`, which matches the type of the `dieselEng` field in the `Car` class.

4. Matching Bean Found:
   - The container identifies the `diesel` bean as a match for the `DieselEngine` type because it is defined in the configuration file with that type.
   - Since there is a match, the container automatically injects the `diesel` bean into the `car` bean's `dieselEng` field.

5. Dependency Resolved:
   - The `Car` bean is instantiated and initialized.
   - During the initialization process, the container invokes the `setDieselEng` method of the `Car` class and passes the `diesel` bean as an argument.
   - The `diesel` bean is set as the value of the `dieselEng` field in the `Car` object, resolving the dependency.

6. Usage:
   - The `Car` object is retrieved from the container using the `context.getBean("car", Car.class)` method.
   - The `drive` method of the `Car` object is called.
   - Inside the `drive` method, the `start` method of the `dieselEng` object is invoked, performing the logic related to starting the engine.

By enabling Autowiring by type, the container scans the beans and looks for a matching type for the dependency of the `car` bean. It automatically identifies the `diesel` bean as the matching dependency and injects it into the `car` bean. This way, the dependency is resolved without the need for explicit configuration or wiring.

Autowiring by type can simplify the configuration process by automatically handling the injection of dependencies based on their types. However, it is important to ensure that there is only one matching bean for the given type to avoid ambiguity errors.

# To demonstrate Autowiring by `constructor` in the code example, you can modify the code as follows:

```java
package in.shivam.beans;

public class Car {
    private DieselEngine dieselEngine;

    public Car(DieselEngine dieselEngine) {
        this.dieselEngine = dieselEngine;
        System.out.println("Car::Constructor");
    }

    public void drive() {
        int start = dieselEngine.start();
        if (start >= 1) {
            System.out.println("Journey Started...");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Engine Failed to Start...!!");
        }
    }
}
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">

    <bean id="dieselEngine" class="in.shivam.beans.DieselEngine"/>

    <bean id="car" class="in.shivam.beans.Car" autowire="constructor"/>

</beans>
```

In the updated code:

1. `Car` Class Modification:
   - The `Car` class now has a constructor that takes a `DieselEngine` parameter.
   - The `dieselEngine` field is no longer directly accessible, as it is assigned through the constructor.

2. XML Configuration:
   - The XML configuration file remains mostly the same.
   - The `car` bean now has the attribute `autowire="constructor"`, indicating that Autowiring by constructor should be performed for this bean.

3. Dependency Resolution:
   - When the container encounters the `car` bean definition, it identifies that Autowiring by constructor is enabled for this bean.
   - The container looks for a bean whose type matches the dependency type of the `car` bean, which is `DieselEngine`.

4. Matching Bean Found:
   - The container searches for a bean of type `DieselEngine` in the configuration file.
   - In your code, there is a bean defined with the id `"dieselEngine"` and class `in.shivam.beans.DieselEngine`, which matches the type of the dependency.

5. Dependency Resolved:
   - The container automatically identifies the matching bean, `"dieselEngine"`, as the dependency for the `car` bean.
   - The `car` bean's constructor is invoked with the `dieselEngine` bean passed as an argument.
   - The `dieselEngine` bean is assigned to the `dieselEngine` field of the `Car` object.

6. Usage:
   - The `Car` object is retrieved from the container using the `context.getBean("car", Car.class)` method.
   - The `drive` method of the `Car` object is called.
   - Inside the `drive` method, the `start` method of the `dieselEngine` object is invoked, performing the logic related to starting the engine.

With these modifications, the Autowiring by constructor mode is demonstrated. The container automatically resolves the dependency of the `car` bean by matching the dependency type (`DieselEngine`) with the available beans in the configuration file.
