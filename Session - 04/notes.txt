Spring Advantages
-----------------

-> It is a free & open source framework.

-> Spring is very light weight framework 

-> Spring is versatile (Adjustable) framework (spring can be integrated with any other java framework available in the market)

-> Spring is non-invasive framework.
(spring framework will not force us to use framework related interfaces or classes)

Ex: To create a servlet we need to implement servlet Interface or we need to extends HttpServlet or GenericServlet. That means servlet is forcing us to use Servlets specific interfaces or classes. 


Note : In Spring we can create a simple pojo then spring will execute our pojo classes.

-> spring works based on POJO and POJI model.

    POJO : Plain old java object.
    POJI : Plain old java interface

-> Spring is not a single framework. It is collection of Modules.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spring Modules
==============

1) Spring core 
2) Spring Context 
3) Spring DAO / Spring JDBC
4) Spring AOP
5) Spring ORM 
6) Spring Web MVC
7) Spring Security
8) Spring REST
9) Spring Data
10) Spring Cloud 
11) Spring Batch etc...

Note: Spring framework is loosely coupled. It will not force to use all Modules.

-> Based on project requirement we can choose which modules we need to use from Spring.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

============
Spring core
============

Note: Spring Core is the base module for all other modules in Spring. TO work with any module in spring first we need to know Spring Core Modules.

Spring Core Module is Spring framework. It is providing IOC container & Dependency Injection.

Note: IOC & DI are fundamental concepts of Spring framework.



-> Spring Context module will deal with configuration related stuff.

-> Spring AOP stands for Aspect Oriented Programming. Spring AOP is used to deal with Cross Cutting logics in application.

    Application = Business Logic + Cross Cutting Logic 

Note: We can separate Business Logic and Cross Cutting logic (Repeated Logics) using AOP module.

-> Spring JDBC / Spring DAO module used to develop Persistence Layer.

-> Spring ORM module is used to develop Persistence Layer with ORM features.

-> Spring Web MVC Module is used to develop web Application.

-> Spring Security module is used to implement Security Features in our application.

-> Spring REST is used to develop RESTful services (REST API)

-> Spring Data is used to develop Persistence Layer. It provided pre-defined repositories to simplify CRUD operations.

-> Spring Cloud providing cloud concepts like Service Registry, Cloud Gateway, FeignClient, Filters, Routing etc...

-> Spring Batch is used to implement Batch Processing in our application, Batch Processing means bulk operations.

-----------------------------------------------------------
-> Spring framework released in 2003 as Spring 0.9 version

-> Spring framework released in 2004 (First Production released)

-> The current version of Spring is 5.x version (released in 2017) 

Note: Spring 5.x version introduced Reactive Programming in Spring.

Note: Spring Boot 1.x released in 2014

-> The current version of Spring Boot is 3.x version

Note: Spring Boot is an extension for spring framework.
