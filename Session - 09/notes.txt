-> If we develop the project without using spring framework then programmer should perform dependency injection among the classes in the application.

-> If programmer performs dependency injection then classes will become tightly coupled.

-> In Realtime project we will have 100's of classes then performing Dependency Injection is very very difficult and code will become cumbersome.

-> To overcome this problem we can use Spring IOC container.

-> If we develop the project using spring framework then spring IOC will take care of dependency injections in our application.

-> IOC is a principle which is responsible to manage and collaborate dependencies among the classes available in the application.

Note: IOC stands for Inversion of Control. DI stands for Dependency Injection.

-> In spring framework IOC will perform DI.

-> IOC provide Beans as output which is ready to use.

the classes which are managed by IOC container those are called as spring Bean.
